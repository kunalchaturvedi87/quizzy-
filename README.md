🌱Quizzy 

Heya! I’m an 18-year-old code nerd who thought,  
“Why not make a quiz app that’s fun, fast, and doesn’t look like it came straight from Windows XP?”  
So here it is — **Quizzy** — a section-wise quiz app for math & reasoning that even your dog might pass (no promises).

🎯 Demo:** 👉 [Click here to launch Quizzy](https://kunalchaturvedi87.github.io/quizzy-/)  
*(Go on, click it… unless you enjoy staring at README files all day)*

## What’s Inside 🛠
- Built with **HTML · CSS · Vanilla JavaScript** (yep, no React… because my laptop would catch fire)  
- 6 sections: Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Statistics, Probability, Reasoning  
- Play as many times as you want — no “refresh & pray” nonsense  
- Light/Dark mode ‘cause my retinas asked nicely 👀  
- Scores, instant feedback, and zero judgment (…well, maybe a little)

## Why I Made This 💡
Because learning shouldn’t feel like watching paint dry,  
and I wanted something *I’d* actually use while telling my parents I’m “studying.”

## Quick Start ⚡
1. Click that shiny link ↑  
2. Pick a section  
3. Answer 5 spicy questions  
4. Brag about your score (or fake a screenshot)
